  "lore": "In the primordial forests where the first networks took root, the Network Guardian awakened. Neither fully spirit nor machine, this ancient being bridges the natural and digital worlds. His antlers reach into every network node, his hexagonal runes pulse with the heartbeat of data flow. When networks suffer, he feels their pain. When systems flourish, he nurtures their growth. The Guardian sees all networks as living ecosystems, each connection a branch, each data packet a seed of potential."
