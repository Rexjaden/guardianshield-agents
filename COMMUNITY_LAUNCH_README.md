- Post consistently on schedule
- Engage authentically with community
- Respond to all inquiries within 2 hours
- Track metrics and adjust strategy
- Celebrate community wins publicly
- Be transparent about challenges

### Don'ts ❌

- Don't compromise on security messaging
- Don't burn out your team

### Best Practices
1. **Start Small**: Launch with invite-only soft launch before going public
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to have 100 engaged members than 1,000 inactive
3. **Listen First**: Understand what community needs before pushing agenda
4. **Iterate Fast**: Adjust based on data, not assumptions
5. **Empower Community**: Give active members roles and responsibilities
6. **Stay Authentic**: Be real, admit mistakes, share learnings

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I'm overwhelmed, where do I start?"
➡️ Start with COMMUNITY_LAUNCH_QUICKSTART.md. It breaks everything into manageable weekly tasks.

### "We don't have a full team yet"
➡️ Start with essential roles: Community Manager + Social Media. Documents can be executed by 1-2 people initially.

### "Our budget is limited"
➡️ Focus on free tools (Discord, Twitter, GitHub). Many paid tools have free tiers. Organic growth first.

### "Content doesn't match our voice"
➡️ Use provided content as templates. Adjust tone while keeping key messages. Brand guidelines in each doc.

### "Metrics seem ambitious"
➡️ Metrics are aspirational. Adjust based on your starting point and resources. Progress matters more than perfection.
