# Shield Token Image Integration Instructions

## 🎯 Quick Setup Methods:

### Method 1: Save Image File
1. Right-click your shield token image
2. Save as: `assets/images/shield-token.png` (or .jpg)
3. Refresh http://localhost:5500/shield-token-test.html

### Method 2: Drag & Drop in VS Code
1. In VS Code Explorer, open the `assets/images/` folder
2. Drag your shield token image directly into that folder
3. Rename it to `shield-token.png`
4. Refresh the test page

### Method 3: Base64 Embedding (Most Reliable)
1. Let me embed your image directly into the HTML
2. Send me the image file and I'll convert it to base64
3. This ensures it always displays correctly

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### If the image doesn't show up:
- Check the browser console (F12) for error messages
- Verify the image is in the correct folder
- Make sure the filename matches exactly: `shield-token.png` or `shield-token.jpg`

### If the image looks wrong:
- The styling might need adjustment for your specific image
- Let me know what's wrong and I'll fix the CSS
- Image might need transparency background or different dimensions
