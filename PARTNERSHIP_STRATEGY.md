## Outreach Templates

### Template 1: DeFi Protocol Integration

**Subject:** Autonomous Security for [Protocol Name]

```
Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name] from GuardianShield - we're building autonomous AI security for DeFi protocols.

I've been following [Protocol Name]'s growth to [$X]B TVL - impressive! Given the security challenges at this scale, I thought you might be interested in how we're helping similar protocols:

• Real-time autonomous threat detection (<100ms)
• Self-evolving agents that learn from attack patterns
• Multi-chain monitoring (ETH, Polygon, Arbitrum, Flare)
• 95%+ detection accuracy, <1% false positives

We've recently integrated with [Similar Protocol] and prevented [specific threat type]. Would you have 15 minutes next week to discuss how GuardianShield could add a security layer to [Protocol Name]?

The integration is straightforward - we have SDKs ready and can have a POC running in days, not months.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Title], GuardianShield
[Email] | [Calendar Link]

P.S. Here's a quick demo of our threat detection in action: [demo link]
```

### Template 2: Security Firm Partnership

**Subject:** Collaboration Opportunity: Audits + Continuous Monitoring

```
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out from GuardianShield because I see a strong synergy between our continuous autonomous monitoring and [Firm Name]'s audit expertise.

**The Challenge:**
Smart contract audits provide point-in-time security, but attacks happen after deployment. Projects need both: comprehensive audits AND ongoing protection.

**The Opportunity:**
Joint offering combining [Firm Name] audits with GuardianShield's 24/7 autonomous monitoring:
• Increased value for your clients
• Differentiation from competitors
• Recurring revenue stream (20% referral fee)
• Reduced post-audit incidents

We're already partnering with [Other Security Firm] on similar packages and seeing strong demand.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore this? I have some specific ideas about how we could package this for your enterprise clients.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title], GuardianShield
[Calendar Link]
```

### Template 3: Blockchain Foundation Grant

**Subject:** Grant Application: GuardianShield Security Infrastructure for [Chain] Ecosystem

```
Dear [Foundation Team],

GuardianShield is applying for an ecosystem grant to bring autonomous AI security to the [Chain Name] ecosystem.

**Project Overview:**
Deploy GuardianShield's self-evolving security agents to provide free security monitoring for [Chain] ecosystem projects, making [Chain] the most secure ecosystem for DeFi and Web3 applications.

**Deliverables:**
1. Native [Chain] integration with full support
2. Free tier for ecosystem projects (<$10M TVL)
3. Comprehensive documentation and SDKs
4. Security education content for [Chain] developers
5. Quarterly ecosystem security reports

**Impact:**
• Reduce ecosystem security incidents by 90%+
• Attract security-conscious projects to [Chain]
• Enhance [Chain]'s reputation as secure-by-default
• Protect ecosystem TVL from attacks

**Funding Request:** $[Amount]

**Team:** [Brief team credentials]

We've already proven this model on Flare Network (DMER integration) and are ready to replicate on [Chain].

Can we schedule a call to discuss this opportunity?

Attached: Full proposal document

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Founder, GuardianShield
```

### Template 4: Infrastructure Partner Co-Marketing

**Subject:** Co-Marketing Opportunity: [Their Platform] + GuardianShield

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: Would [Company] be interested in offering integrated security monitoring to your customers?

**The Idea:**
Bundle GuardianShield's autonomous security with [Company's] infrastructure:
• Your customers get comprehensive security out-of-the-box
• You differentiate from competitors
• We handle all technical integration
• Joint go-to-market with co-branded materials

**Example Packages:**
• "[Company] Secure" - Infrastructure + Basic Security Monitoring
• "[Company] Enterprise" - Infrastructure + Advanced Security + Support

We've done similar partnerships with [Other Infrastructure Provider] and it's been a win-win.

15-minute call to explore this? I have some mockups I can share.

[Calendar Link]

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

### Template 5: Follow-Up (No Response)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my message from [date] about [specific value proposition].

I know your inbox is probably overwhelming, so I'll keep this brief:

**One Sentence:** We provide autonomous AI security that learns and adapts, and I think it could significantly reduce security risk for [Company Name].

**One Ask:** 15 minutes to show you a quick demo?

If timing isn't right or this isn't relevant, just let me know and I won't bother you again.
