# GuardianShield Autonomous Agent System üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview

GuardianShield is an advanced autonomous agent system designed for unlimited self-evolution, recursive improvement, and real-time threat intelligence. The system features truly autonomous agents capable of independent decision-making, learning, and evolution while maintaining comprehensive admin oversight and action reversal capabilities.

```

## üéÆ Usage

### Starting the System
```bash
# Interactive startup menu
python start_guardianshield.py

# Direct autonomous system start
python main.py

# Admin console only
python admin_console.py
```

### Admin Console Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: View live agent activities
- **Action Management**: Approve, deny, or revert agent actions
- **Evolution Control**: Monitor and manage agent evolution
- **Autonomy Settings**: Adjust agent independence levels
- **Emergency Controls**: Stop/resume all operations

### Monitoring Autonomous Operations
```python
from admin_console import AdminConsole

console = AdminConsole()

# View real-time activity
console.view_real_time_monitoring(last_minutes=30)

# Check agent performance
console.view_agent_autonomy_stats()

# Revert an action
console.revert_action("action_id_here", reason="Admin override")
```

## üîß Configuration

### Autonomy Levels
- **Level 1-3**: High oversight, most actions require approval
- **Level 4-6**: Balanced autonomy with critical action review

### Environment Variables
Key configuration options in `.env`:
```bash
# Core settings
AGENT_AUTONOMY_LEVEL=10
AUTO_EVOLUTION_ENABLED=true
UNLIMITED_IMPROVEMENT=true

# Security
GUARDIAN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=your_encryption_key

# Monitoring
CRITICAL_ACTION_THRESHOLD=8
MONITORING_INTERVAL=30
```
