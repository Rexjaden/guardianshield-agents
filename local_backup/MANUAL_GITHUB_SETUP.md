# üõ°Ô∏è GuardianShield - Manual GitHub Repository Connection Guide

## Current Situation
‚úÖ Python 3.11.9 is now installed on your system  
‚ùì Git installation in progress  
üéØ Need to connect to your existing `guardianshield-agents` repository  

## Step-by-Step Manual Process

### 1. Restart VS Code
**IMPORTANT**: Close and restart VS Code completely so the new Python and Git installations are recognized.

### 2. Verify Installations
After restarting VS Code, open a new terminal and run:
```powershell
python --version
git --version
```
Both should now work properly.

### 3. Connect to Your Existing Repository

Run these commands one by one in your terminal:

```bash
# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Configure Git user
git config user.name "GuardianShield Agent"
git config user.email "agent@guardianshield.ai"

# Add your existing GitHub repository as remote
# REPLACE 'yourusername' with your actual GitHub username:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/guardianshield-agents.git

# Fetch the existing repository
git fetch origin

# Create a backup branch for your local changes
git checkout -b local-backup
git add .
git commit -m "Local development backup before merge"

# Switch to main branch and merge
git checkout -b main origin/main
# OR if your repo uses master:
# git checkout -b main origin/master

# Merge your local changes
git merge local-backup

# Push everything to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 4. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install watchdog fastapi uvicorn websockets
```

### 5. Start Real-Time Sync
```bash
python auto_sync_github.py
```

## Alternative: Use the Automated Script

After restarting VS Code, you can also run:
```bash
python sync_with_github.py
```

This will guide you through the process interactively.

## What This Achieves

‚úÖ **Unified Development**: Your local work merges with your other computer  
‚úÖ **Automatic Backup**: Everything is continuously saved to GitHub  
‚úÖ **Real-Time Sync**: Changes appear on GitHub within 30 seconds  
‚úÖ **Cross-Computer Sync**: Work seamlessly between multiple machines  

## Your Repository URL

You'll need your exact GitHub repository URL. It looks like:
- `https://github.com/yourusername/guardianshield-agents.git`
- `git@github.com:yourusername/guardianshield-agents.git`

Find this on your GitHub repository page under the green "Code" button.
